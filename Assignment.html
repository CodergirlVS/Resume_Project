<h1>Little Bit About Me!</h1>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Vaidehi Sapre and this is my space on the web where you can get to know me more. I live in Pleasanton, California which is the home of Silicon Valley.
    I hold a Masters in Accounting and Finance and am currently learning to be 
    a Fullstack developer with Code The Dream. My journey into coding began while
    I was working with my daughter's school PTA, managing and creating content for 
    their PTA Website. I had somuch fun doing it and now am very passionate about it too.
    In my free time I enjoy paying tennis, gardening, knitting, and hiking. I believe in sharing
    and Iâ€™m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic 
    looking websites.
